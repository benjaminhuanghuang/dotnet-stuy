# Create record types
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/tutorials/records

Beginning with C# 9, you use the record keyword to define a `reference` type that provides built-in functionality for encapsulating data. 

C# 10 allows the `record class` syntax as a synonym to clarify a reference type, and `record struct` to define a value type with similar functionality. You can create record types with immutable properties by using positional parameters or standard property syntax.
