https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/events/learn-events/learnlive-mobile-desktop-apps-dotnet-maui/


## Project structure
- The `Resources` folder contains shared fonts, images, and assets used by all platforms.

- The MauiProgram.cs file contains the code that `configures the app` and specifies that the App class should be used to run the application.

- The App.xaml.cs file, the constructor for the App class `creates a new instance of the AppShell` class, which is then displayed in the application window.

- The AppShell.xaml file contains the `main layout` for the application and `starting page` of MainPage.

- The MainPage.xaml file contains the `layout for the page`. This layout includes the XAML code for a button with the caption Click me, and an image that displays the dotnet_bot.png file. There are two other labels as well.

- The MainPage.xaml.cs file contains the `application logic` for the page. Specifically, the MainPage class includes a method named OnCounterClicked that runs when the user taps the Click me button.
