# Reliability

Resilient
• Recover from failures and continue to function
• Return app to working state after failure

Availability
• Whether users can access the workload

Distributed apps
• Assume unreliable communication
• Distributed workloads can make app more reliable

Communication issues

- loss of network connectivity
- Unavailability of a service
- Timeouts

## Design for failure

## Retry pattern
