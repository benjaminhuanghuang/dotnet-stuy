All the way back in .NET Framework 1.0, there was the Asynchronous Programming Model pattern known as 
the `asynchronous programming model (APM)` or `Begin/End pattern` or `IAsyncResult pattern`. 


There would be two corresponding methods as part of the pattern: a BeginDoStuff method and an EndDoStuff method:
```
class Handler
{
    public int DoStuff(string arg);

    public IAsyncResult BeginDoStuff(string arg, AsyncCallback? callback, object? state);
    public int EndDoStuff(IAsyncResult asyncResult);
}
```

The Begin method was responsible for initiating the asynchronous operation, and if provided with a callback (often referred to as the “continuation” for the initial operation), it was also responsible for ensuring the callback was invoked when the asynchronous operation completed. 
The Begin method would also construct an instance of a type that implemented IAsyncResult, using the optional state to populate that IAsyncResult‘s AsyncState property:
