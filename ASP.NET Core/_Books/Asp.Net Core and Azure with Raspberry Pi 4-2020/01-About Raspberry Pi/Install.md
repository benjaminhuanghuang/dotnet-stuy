## SD Card
Make sure that you buy a Class 10 memory card. The card class determines the write speed of your card. Class 10 has a write speed of 10MB/s and class 4 has 4MB/s.
I always recommend a memory card of 16GB or 32GB 


## Method 1: Use the Raspberry Pi Imager
The Raspberry Pi foundation created a tool called Raspberry Pi Imager, which allows you to easily write the Raspbian to an SD card.

The selected operating system will be added to the SD card.
